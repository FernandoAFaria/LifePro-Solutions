    Form is
    accepted by LifePro.<br><br>

    1. LifePro Services. LifePro shall perform the services set forth in the document Client executed entitled Services
    Agreement and any subsequent documents entitled a Statement of Work or Order Forms (including but not limited to
    emails
    or online forms) ("LifePro Services"). The Services Agreement constitutes the initial Order Form or Statement of
    Work.
    All work will be performed professionally and in accordance with industry standards.<br><br>

    2. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by its terms.<br><br>

    3. Compensation. Client shall pay LifePro the compensation as set forth in the Order Form or Statement of Work.<br>
    <br>
    4. Independent Contractor Status. Both Client and LifePro agree that LifePro will act as an independent contractor
    in
    the performance of its duties under this Agreement.<br><br>

    5. Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other party, except that
    either party may assign this Agreement in conjunction with the sale of substantially all assets of the assigning
    party
    or a controlling ownership interest in the assigning party after 10 days advance written notice to the other party.
    This prohibition against assignment does not preclude the use of contractors by LifePro.<br><br>

    6. Confidentiality.<br><br>

    a. "Confidential Information" Defined. "Confidential Information" means any data, materials or information that is
    not
    generally known to the public and that is owned or possessed by either party ("Disclosing Party") and is disclosed
    to
    the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether in oral, written, digital or other form of disclosure. Confidential
    Information also includes any third party information which Disclosing Party is required to keep confidential
    ("Third
    Party Confidential Information"). Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties agree that the terms of this
    Agreement constitute Confidential Information (yet the fact that the parties have entered into the agreement and
    the
    general nature of the relationship between the parties is not confidential). This agreement may be disclosed by the
    Receiving Party in proper due diligence processes in business transactions in accordance with industry standards.<br>
    <br><br>
    b. "Trade Secrets" Defined. "Trade Secret" shall mean information owned or possessed by Disclosing Party, without
    regard to form, that is disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party, including but not limited to, technical
    or
    non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a
    process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers,
    in
    any form or format, which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which: (i) derives economic
    value,
    actual or potential, from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other
    persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are
    reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. Trade Secrets specifically include any Confidential
    Information satisfying the above criteria.<br><br>

    c. Excluded From "Confidential Information." Confidential Information does not include any data or information
    which
    Receiving Party can demonstrate: (i) was already known to Receiving Party at the time of disclosure; (ii) was
    independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (iii)
    is
    in the public domain; (iv) was rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party by a third party without obligation of
    confidentiality; or (v) the fact that Client is a LifePro customer and the general nature of the work performed by
    LifePro for Client.<br><br>

    d. Prohibition Against Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information & Trade Secrets. During the term of this
    Agreement, and indefinitely thereafter, Receiving Party will not, except as otherwise expressly directed by
    Disclosing
    Party, use, copy, or disclose, or permit any unauthorized person access to, any of Disclosing Party's Trade
    Secrets,
    except as expressly permitted herein and necessary for accomplishment of activities required hereby. During the
    term of
    this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after termination hereof, Receiving Party will not use, copy, or
    disclose, or permit any unauthorized person access to, Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except as
    expressly
    directed by such party or as permitted herein. Receiving Party agrees to comply with any confidentiality agreements
    or
    the like to which Disclosing Party is a party to the extent Disclosing Party notifies Receiving Party of such
    agreements and obligations in writing prior to execution of this Agreement.<br><br>

    e. Confidential Information & Trade Secrets Disseminated Only on Need to Know Basis. Receiving Party agrees that it
    will disclose Confidential Information or Trade Secrets to its employees or agents only as necessary for the
    performance of Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement. Prior to disclosing Confidential Information or
    Trade Secrets to such employees or agents, Receiving Party will verify with Disclosing Party that such employees or
    agents are subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements.<br><br>

    f. Safeguards Against Disclosure. Receiving Party agrees to use at least the same degree of care to avoid and
    prevent
    disclosure of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information and Trade Secrets as Receiving Party uses to prevent
    disclosure of its own Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, or Receiving Party shall exercise a commercially
    reasonable degree of care, whichever degree of care is higher.<br><br>

    g. Equitable Relief. Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the misappropriation, unauthorized use or
    disclosure
    of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. In the event of
    any
    breach of any part of this Section by Receiving Party, Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief,
    including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction and/or a permanent injunction. The
    rights of Disclosing Party under this Section are in addition to the rights that Disclosing Party may have under
    this
    Agreement, common law or statutory law.<br><br>

    preceding laws yet otherwise protectable (all of such property being referred to herein as "Intellectual

    Copyright laws is hereby deemed a work made for hire and is owned by Client from the moment of creation. However,
    notwithstanding the foregoing, LifePro retains all rights to works created prior to the execution of this Agreement

    any part of this Section by either party, the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including but not
    limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction and/or a permanent injunction. The rights of the
    parties
    under this Section are in addition to the rights that such parties may have under this Agreement, common law or

    all amounts owed by Client under this Agreement for any reason and all of Client's payment obligations under this
    Agreement are conditions precedent to LifePro's grants of ownership and grants of license under this Section.
    <br><br>
    10. Indemnification. Each party ("Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify and hold the other party, its officers,
    directors, attorneys, employees and agents ("Indemnified Party") harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages,
    expenses, judgments or other liabilities (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees which are
    incurred
    prior to, during or after trial, bankruptcy proceeding or any alternative dispute mechanism, and including but not
    limited to tax liability, interest and penalties) for which Indemnified Party becomes obligated to pay due to (1)
    any
    material breach of this Agreement by Indemnifying Party, its employees or agents, (2) property damage or personal
    injury caused by the negligent or willful acts or omissions by Indemnifying Party, its employees or agents, or (3)
    illegal acts or omissions by Indemnifying Party, its employees or agents.
    <br><br>
    11. Entire Agreement & Modification. This Agreement (made up of these Terms of Service, the Services Agreement
    (which
    constitutes the first order form) and any subsequent Order Forms) represents the entire agreement between the
    parties
    as to the matters referenced herein and is not subject to change or modification except by written agreement signed
    by
    both parties.
    <br><br>
    12. Dispute Resolution. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any issue, dispute, or controversy
    arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement. If any controversy or claim arising out of, or in any way related to, this
    Agreement is not resolved in a reasonable manner, at the request of either party, the matter will settled by
    binding
    arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
    arbitration will take place in Essex county New Jersey. The arbitration award will be valid and binding upon the
    parties, and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced as a final judgment in any court of competent
    jurisdiction.
    However, claims for injunctive relief or other equitable relief may be filed in the state or federal courts of New
    Jersey for an order effective until the conclusion of the arbitration and enforcement of the arbitration award.
    Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, for claims qualifying for small claims court in New Jersey, either
    party
    may sue in small claims court in New Jersey if the good faith effort to resolve the issue/dispute fails after a
    reasonable time (which reasonable time for the purpose of a small claims court action is no later than 10 days from
    the
    date the complainant sends a detailed letter to the other party identifying the complaint and an acceptable
    solution/cure). The arbitrator and court shall award attorneys' fees, costs and expenses to the prevailing party in
    any
    arbitration or court proceeding (including small claims court). The parties agree to initiate arbitration in lieu
    of
    appealing any small claims court judgment. The parties waive in person service of process and agree that service
    pursuant to the notice provision of this Agreement shall constitute sufficient legal service for arbitration or
    litigation (yet this sentence does not create any right to litigation).
    <br><br>
    13. Severability. The covenants set forth in this Agreement shall be considered and construed as separate and
    independent covenants. Should any part or provision of any covenant be held invalid, void or unenforceable in any
    court
    of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void or
    unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement.
    <br><br>
    14. Termination. Except to the extent provided in any Order Form or Statement of Work, this Agreement may be
    terminated
    by either party, with or without cause, upon not less than 30 days written notice of termination to the other party
    (however, prior to a Client providing notice of termination, the Client must make full payment of any amounts due
    LifePro). In the event Client fails to make any timely payment under this Agreement, LifePro may cease performing
    Services or terminate this Agreement effective upon written notice to Client.
    <br><br>
    15. Survivability. The terms and conditions of this Agreement that, by their sense and context, are intended to
    survive
    the termination, performance or completion of this Agreement shall so survive.
    <br><br>
    16. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
    New
    Jersey without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. The state and federal courts located in the State
    of
    New Jersey shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the parties for the purposes of adjudicating all disputes that may
    arise under this Agreement. The parties hereby waive all objections to venue and personal jurisdiction in those
    forums
    for such disputes and agree that service of process may be made by in accordance with the notice provision of this
    Agreement.<br><br>

    17. Waiver. No waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any agreements in connection
    with such waiver, amendment, or modification shall be valid unless in writing duly executed by both parties. No
    delay
    or failure by either party to exercise or enforce at any time any right or provision of this Agreement will be
    considered a waiver thereof or of such party's right thereafter to exercise or enforce each and every right and
    provision of the Agreement. No single waiver will constitute a continuing or subsequent waiver.
    <br><br>
    18. Limitation on Warranties and Cap on Liability.
    <br><br>
    FOR A PERIOD OF 30 DAYS FOLLOWING DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES, THE SERVICES WILL SUBSTANTIALLY CONFORM TO ANY
    SPECIFICATIONS MUTUALLY AGREED TO IN WRITING IN THE ORDER FORM OR STATEMENT OF WORK. IN THE EVENT OF ANY BREACH OF
    THIS
    WARRANTY, LIFEPRO'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND CLIENT'S SOLE REMEDY, IS FOR LIFEPRO TO MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO
    REMEDY
    ANY DEFECTS, ON A TIME AND MATERIALS BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM OR STATEMENT OF WORK. OTHER
    THAN AS STATED HEREIN, LIFEPRO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT
    TO
    THE DELIVERABLES OR SERVICES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
    OR
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    <br><br>
    THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF LIFEPRO OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS (AND CLIENT'S MAXIMUM REMEDY) WITH RESPECT
    TO
    SERVICES OR GOODS PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF ANY KIND ARISING
    OUT
    OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SECTION 10 OF THIS AGREEMENT)
    SHALL
    IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID DURING THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING ANY OCCURRENCE OR INCIDENT OF ANY
    KIND
    GIVING RISE TO LIABILITIES OR DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL LIFEPRO OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE
    (AND
    COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO REMEDY) (I) UNDER ANY THEORY INCLUDING CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT
    PRODUCTS
    LIABILITY) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) FOR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, UNAVAILABILITY
    OF
    DATA OR THE SYSTEM, LOSS OF USE OF COMPUTER HARDWARE, DOWNTIME, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS OR
    CUSTOMERS, OR SOFTWARE OR COMPUTER HARDWARE MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    <br><br>
    19. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any delay or non-performance of any covenant contained herein
    nor
    shall any such delay or non-performance constitute a default hereunder, or give rise to any liability or damages if
    such delay or non-performance is caused by an event of "force majeure." The term "force majeure" means events
    beyond
    the reasonable control of such party. All parties shall make a good faith effort to effectuate this Agreement where
    there is an occurrence of a force majeure during and after the occurrence to the extent commercially reasonable.</p>
